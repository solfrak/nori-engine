Monte Carlo Sampling (60 pts)
=============================

For each of these sections, don't forget to include necessary derivations as well as screenshots of passing $\chi^2$ tests from the <tt>warptest</tt> executable.

Two simple rendering algorithms (40 pts)
========================================

Point lights
------------

Ajax bust illuminated by a point light source:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="ajax-simple-ref.png" alt="Reference">
    <img src="ajax-simple.png" alt="Mine">
</div>

Note: Nori automatically generates both a `.exr` as well as an sRGB tonemapped `.png` image of your rendering that should directly used for the comparison above. Please still commit both versions in your `results/homework-X` folder.

Ambient occlusion
-----------------

Ajax bust rendered using ambient occlusion:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="ajax-ao-ref.png" alt="Reference">
    <img src="ajax-ao.png" alt="Mine">
</div>

Note: Nori automatically generates both a `.exr` as well as an sRGB tonemapped `.png` image of your rendering that should directly used for the comparison above. Please still commit both versions in your `results/homework-X` folder.

Feedback
========

We would appreciate any comments or criticism to improve the projects in future years--naturally, this part will not be graded. Examples of information that is useful to us includes:

* How much time did you spend on the assignment? How was it divided between designing, coding, and testing?
* What advice should we have given you before you started?
* What was hard or surprising about the assignment?
* What did you like or dislike? What else would you change?
