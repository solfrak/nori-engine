**Homework 1**

Student name: Samuel Laporte

Sciper number: 366873

Feedback
========
Very clear information about how to setup the project. The only problem I had was in rendering because it
took 11 minutes to render this simple image. Somebody made me realise that I compiled the project with the 
debug flag (Cmake extension in vscode changed my setting)

I think it would be better for students to give them an aproximate time for the rendering (i.e: "It should be less than ...")
In that way, I would have know right at the start that I did something wrong.
